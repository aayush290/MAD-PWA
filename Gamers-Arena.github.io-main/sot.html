                  <p class="content-text">Sea of Thieves is a 2018 first-person multiplayer action-adventure game in which players cooperate with each other to explore an open world via a pirate ship. The game is described as a "shared world adventure game", which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly during their adventures, sometimes forming alliances, sometimes going head-to-head. The player assumes the role of a pirate who completes voyages from different trading companies in order to become the ultimate pirate legend. Players need to become at least level 50 with 3 of the trading companies to become a Pirate Legend. Sea of Thieves is developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Studios.<br>

                    The game was first conceptualized in 2014. Rare was inspired by players of PC titles such as Eve Online, DayZ and Rust, who used the tools provided by these games to create their own personal stories. The company explored different settings for the game, such as vampires and dinosaurs, though it eventually settled on the pirate theme, drawing inspirations from films including Pirates of the Caribbean and The Goonies. The game features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as the development team wanted to encourage both casual and experienced players to play together. Compared to Rare's other games, Sea of Thieves's development process was more transparent, with Rare inviting fans to test the game's early builds.

               Microsoft Studios released the game in March 2018 for Windows and Xbox One; it was also one of the earliest first-party games released for Xbox Game Pass subscribers. The game received generally mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's ship combat, multiplayer gameplay, visuals, and game physics. Criticisms were directed at the game's lack of content, progression, and shallow gameplay. Rare envisioned the title as a "game as a service" and released numerous content updates after the game's release.[1] The game is a commercial success and has attracted more than 15 million players as of July 2020. It also became the most successful new intellectual property (IP) Microsoft have released in the generation. An enhanced version of the game also released for Xbox Series X/S in November 2020. A seasonal system was added to the game on 28 January 2021, allowing players to receive rewards by completing challenges.

                Sea of Thieves is a first-person perspective action-adventure. At the beginning of the game, the player selects their procedurally generated player avatar.[2] The game is set in a shared world, which means groups of players will encounter each other throughout their adventures. Solo and duo players sail around in a nimble sloop while players playing in a group control a larger 3 man brigantine or a 4 man galleon cooperatively by assuming different roles such as steering the ship, manning the cannons, navigating, boarding enemy ships, and scouting from the crow's nest. Occasionally players may encounter hostile players who may attack them with cannonballs or board their ship. If areas under the deck take damage, water will flow in and cause the ship to gradually sink. Players need to patch up the holes with planks of wood and bail out water using buckets. Alliances can be established with other parties of players. They will receive gold bonuses when a group in the same alliance completes a voyage. Forming an alliance does not prevent players from attacking each other. If the player dies, they are sent to a ghost ship known as the Ferry of the Damned where they wait until they can respawn. A competitive multiplayer mode named "Arena" was introduced in the Anniversary update; it allows four teams of players to compete against each other by gathering silver in smaller maps.
