                  <p class="content-text">Forza Motorsport 7 is a 2017 racing video game developed by Turn 10 Studios and published by Microsoft Studios, serving as the tenth installment in the Forza series. It was released on Windows 10 and the Xbox One family of consoles on October 3, 2017, with early access to those players pre-ordered the game's Ultimate and Deluxe editions.<br>
                    <br>
               Forza Motorsport 7 is a racing video game featuring over 700 carsâ€”including new Forza Edition cars, most of which have been brought over from Forza Horizon 3 and more than 200 different configurations to race on across 32 locations at launch, including all from Forza Motorsport 6; a fictional street circuit in Dubai is one of the new circuits and several tracks returning from Forza Motorsport 4 including Maple Valley Raceway, Mugello Circuit and Suzuka Circuit. Two features that are new to the Motorsport title include dynamic weather (previously seen in Horizon titles) and customisable drivers.

                Forza Motorsport 7 was developed by Turn 10 Studios alongside the Xbox One X console, with Turn 10 providing the Xbox hardware team with feedback. In mid-November 2017, the Xbox hardware team supplied Turn 10 with a prototype Xbox One X system. Turn 10 was able to get their ForzaTech demo running on the system within two days after receiving the prototype console. The game runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, while running at 1080p at similar frame rate on the base Xbox One models.
                <br><br>
                The game does not feature any Toyota and Lexus production road vehicles due to licensing issues between the manufacturer and most non-Japanese video game developers that started in 2017. Only the company's selected race and pre customized vehicles including 3 Camry NASCARs, Eagle MkIII, the Arctic Trucks Hilux AT38, Toyota T100 SR5 Trophy Trucks and the Subaru BRZ are featured, then Land Cruiser Prado AT37 Arctic Trucks featured via DLC. However, Volkswagen returns after being absent in Horizon 3, with some cars being brought over from Horizon 2 and Motorsport 6, as well as some new inclusions.
                <br><br>
                Forza Motorsport 7 was announced at Microsoft's press conference during E3 2017 on June 11. The 2018 Porsche 911 GT2 RS was revealed alongside the game as part of a six-year licensing deal between Microsoft and car manufacturer Porsche. The game launched simultaneously on Windows 10 and Xbox One, and is slated to be available at launch for the Xbox One X. However, the OneDrive music support will be announced 'at a later date'. The first monthly car pack called the "Samsung QLED TV Forza Motorsport 7 Car Pack", was released on November 7, 2017. That DLC includes one more Toyota vehicle, the Arctic Trucks Land Cruiser.
