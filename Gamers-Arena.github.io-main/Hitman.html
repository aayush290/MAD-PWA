                  <p class="content-text">Like its predecessors, Hitman 3 is a stealth game played from a third-person perspective and players once again assume control of assassin Agent 47. In the game, 47 travels to various locations and carries out contracted assassinations, continuing the story of the last two games. The base game features six new locations: Dubai, Dartmoor, Berlin, Chongqing, Mendoza and an epilogue set in the Carpathian Mountains, Romania.Owners of Hitman or Hitman 2 are able to import maps, levels and their progress into Hitman 3.<br>
                    <br>
                    The new locations in Hitman 3 include persistent shortcuts, a new gameplay feature to the series. Each stage includes several initially locked doors which can only be unlocked from one side; once unlocked, these doors stay open in all future playthroughs, allowing initially closed-off locations to be reached more quickly.

               The game features PlayStation VR compatibility on the PlayStation 4 version, with support for PlayStation 5 via backwards compatibility.[7] The VR functionality also retroactively applies to levels imported from the previous two entries.[8] Unlike Hitman 2, there are no multiplayer modes, with Sniper Assassin being purely single player, and Ghost Mode being removed entirely.[9] However, Hitman 3 kept Contracts Mode, where a player can select up to five targets across the 24 maps in the series with rules and complications, this mode gives the player extra possibilities after the main missions.

                On 27 August 2020, digital-only pre-orders for the game launched for PlayStation, PC and Xbox players. It was also announced that a Deluxe Edition of the game would be released, which includes Deluxe Escalations, in-game items and suits as well as digital soundtracks for the trilogy and a digital book featuring information about targets and locations from the trilogy.[22] On 8 September 2020, pre-orders for Stadia went live.[23] On 15 October 2020, it was announced that physical copies of an exclusive variant of the Deluxe Edition containing all the digital content and an exclusive physical passport would be released by Limited Run Games.[24] On 30 October 2020, standard retail physical copies for both editions of the game were announced through traditional brick and mortar retail stores.

                Hitman 3 is a superb instalment of IO's idiosyncratic but much-loved stealth series." GamesRadar+ gave the game 4.5/5 stars, praising the "fun and imaginative murders, beautiful levels to explore, [and] incredible world-building" and calling it a "slick and entertaining conclusion to the trilogy". GameSpot wrote: "What's good about Hitman--its level design and the creativity, experimentation, and exploration that affords--is great in Hitman 3."
