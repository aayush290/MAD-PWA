                  <p class="content-text">Football Manager 2021 (officially abbreviated as FM21) is a football-management simulation video game developed by Sports Interactive and published by Sega. It was released worldwide for iOS, Android, macOS and Windows on 24 November 2020. The streamlined version of the game titled Football Manager 2021 Touch was released on 1 December 2020 for the same platforms, and for Nintendo Switch on 15 December 2020. The similar version titled Xbox Edition was released on 1 December 2020 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Windows 10 via the Microsoft Store. It will be the first game in the series to appear on an Xbox platform since Football Manager 2008.<br>
                    <br>
                    FM21's headline features cover a number of key areas of the game including the interaction system, matchday experience and the recruitment module. There are new communication methods, including gestures, and new interaction options between the manager, their players and the media. There are new presentation elements before, during and after a match and an overhaul to the match engine AI. Expected goals (or xG) makes its debut in the series as part of a wider suite of data analysis changes through an xG model, built by Sports Interactive in partnership with SciSports. Trophy presentations have been revamped too.

               Managers can also take more control of their club's recruitment strategy with a new recruitment meeting.
                <br><br>
                FM21 features 117 leagues from 52 nations across five continents: Africa, Asia (including Australia), Europe, North America and South America. Coverage is heavily slanted towards European teams, with 34 of its 51 constituent countries having playable leagues, while South Africa is the only country of Africa's total 54 that is covered.
                <br><br>
                29 leagues (across 14 countries) were fully licensed for the game, as was KNVB ("Team Holland"). Italy's Serie A has licences for all its clubs except Juventus, who appear as Zebre once again. The German national team was not licensed, however, having been reintroduced in FM20.
