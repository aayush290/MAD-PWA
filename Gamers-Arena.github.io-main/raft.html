                  <p class="content-text">Raft is a video game from 2018 that was developed by Redbeet Interactive and published by Axolot Games. The game is played from the first-person perspective and can be played either in the Single Player Mode or Multiplayer Mode. With the latter, the server is automatically provided by the game and the game takes place in co-op mode.<br>
                    <br>
                    At the start, the player starts on a raft in the middle of an ocean. The player starts with only a hook with which they can fish barrels, wood, palm fronds, plastic, and other objects out of the water. The player can leave the raft and collect things while swimming, but must be careful as the raft can get swept away by the current and the player can be attacked or killed by the shark who is always near the raft. Using a crafting system, the player can use the collected content to assemble and research new items and to expand and improve the raft. For example, tools, weapons and nets can be manufactured, control and guidance of the raft can be improved, technical systems can be manufactured and purely visual changes can be made.

               The player also needs to manage basic needs like hunger and thirst by catching or growing food and purifying water to drink. During the game, the raft may pass by islands which the player can explore to get special items and resources. The player can also dive in coastal regions and collect special items.

                With the help of a two-way radio. radio built in the research table, the creator unveils the game's storyline. The world has been deserted. The protagonist which the players play as is searching for his wife and daughter. Using the two-way radio, the players can find nearby radio signals by changing the radio frequency. Once, the player found the source of the radio. It takes you through a sequence of adventures on that particular land where you can find more information on the survivors and how the world turns into this in the first place. All of this information will be recorded in a journal where the player can refer back on. After gathering all the basic storylines, the players will be given a new radio frequency to find the next storyline. The game has only been updated to Chapter 2, so the storyline has not yet been finished nor perfected.Raft was developed by three Swedish students from Uppsala University. Development started in 2016 and is still ongoing.[2][7][8] On May 23, 2018, Raft was released as a Steam early access game. Raft had previously been distributed on the indie platform Itch.io, where it is still available as a free download.[1][9] A Linux version was discontinued after version 1.05 due to time constraints. Two weeks after launch the game was the number 3 most played game on Steam and had sold over 400,000 copies. The game updates frequently and new functions are regularly added.[3][10]

                The German composer Jannik Schmidt is responsible for the soundtrack of the game.
