                  <p class="content-text">It Takes Two is an action-adventure platformer developed by Hazelight Studios and published by Electronic Arts under the EA Originals label. The game was released for Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and Series S in March 2021. Like A Way Out, Hazelight's debut title, It Takes Two does not have a single-player option; it is playable only in either online or local split screen co-op between two players.<br>
                    <br>
                    It Takes Two is an action-adventure video game with elements from platform games. It is specifically designed for split-screen cooperative multiplayer, which means that it must be played with another player through either local or online play. The game features a large number of game mechanics from various video game genres.[1] These gameplay mechanics are connected to the story and the theme of the level. For instance, in one level, Cody gains the ability to rewind time, whereas May can replicate herself. Players have to cooperate with each other and utilize these abilities in order to progress. The game also features a large number of minigames.

               Cody and May, a married couple, are planning on divorce after Cody argues with May about her working all the time and May arguing back that Cody never shows even a little appreciation for her job. After telling their daughter Rose that they are breaking up, Rose takes her hand-made dolls, which look like her parents, into the family shed, and tries to repair their relationship by play-acting. The parents find themselves trapped inside the dolls' bodies in consequence of a tear landing on the dolls. Dr. Hakim, a relationship-therapy book, tells May and Cody that he has been given the job of trying to fix their relationship as they try to reach Rose.

                At first, Cody and May are more focused on trying to reach Rose, who they hope knows of a way to return them to their human bodies. However, Dr. Hakim continually interferes with their progress, often putting obstacles and tests in their way to force them to collaborate to progress. They also come across magically anthropomorphised versions of their old possessions, who criticize Cody and May over their mistreatment and negligence of both their possessions and Rose. As they travel all around their property, Cody and May are reminded of the positive memories they had together, as well as what originally drew them together to become a couple. Meanwhile, Rose continues to do her best to mend the relationship between her parents, but both Cody and May's real bodies have fallen unconscious and will not respond to her. Thinking her parents are ignoring her, Rose comes to believe that she is the reason their marriage is falling apart, and decides to run away in hopes that will make them stay together.

                After a long journey, Cody and May finally complete Dr. Hakim's final test, which is to recreate the song May used to sing. As May sings, the relationship between her and Cody is rekindled and they kiss, which reverses the spell on them. They reawaken in their real bodies and are shocked to learn that Rose has already run away. Fortunately, they are able to find her at a nearby bus stop and assure her that she is not the cause of their arguments, and that they will always remain a family. The trio then return home with a new perspective on their relationship.
