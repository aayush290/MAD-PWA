                  <p class="content-text">Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric survival horror video game developed by Behaviour Interactive. Dead by Daylight was released for Microsoft Windows in June 2016,[2][3] released in PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2017, released in Nintendo Switch on September 24, 2019, and a mobile port was released in iOS and Android on April 17, 2020. The Stadia version was released in October 2020. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions released on November 12, 2020. The game is played as a one versus four online multiplayer where one player takes on the role of the savage killer, and the other four players play as survivors, trying to escape the killer and avoid being caught and sacrificed to a malevolent force known as the Entity.<br>
                    <br>
                    Alongside several original characters, the game also includes downloadable (DLC) characters from several horror franchises such as Halloween, Left 4 Dead, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Saw, Evil Dead, Scream, Stranger Things, Silent Hill, Crypt TV and Resident Evil.
               <br>
               <br>    
               A group of up to 4 survivors must elude 1 moderately powerful killer bent on sacrificing them on hooks to "The Entity". The survivors' perspectives are third-person, while the killer's perspective is first-person.[1] The survivors cannot fight against the killer unless using special perks, items or obstacles used throughout the map to stun the killer.[9] They must use such obstacles in the form of wooden pallets, windows, and items that they either find inside chests or bring before the match starts to help them run from the killer for as long as they can.
                <br><br>
                In order to escape, survivors must repair 5 of the 7 generators scattered across the entire map to power the exit gates, then they must open the exit gates and leave the area themselves or find a hatch to jump into. Repairing a single generator take 80 charges. 1 charge is equal to 1 second in game normally, but there exist perks and toolboxes that accelerate the speed of charges. The exit gates take 20 charges to open and likewise, the time can be affected by perks. Toolboxes do not affect exit gate repair speed.
                <br><br>
                Most killers only have one form of locomotion, moving at a fast pace, which is moderately faster than the pace of a sprinting survivor, the average killer speed being 4.6 m/s compared to survivors' 4 m/s. When hunting the survivors, the killer must capture them by either striking them twice with their weapon (the first hit reduces the survivor to the "injured" state and gives them a speed boost that lasts as long as the successful hit cooldown, while the second hit drops them to "dying" and crawling on the ground) or grabbing them in one move by either catching them inside a locker, while attempting to vault over pallets or through windows (these work only when the survivor is injured, and does a slow vault or a medium vault), while repairing a generator, or trying to rescue a fellow survivor from a hook. Some killers have secondary attacks that deal double damage and put survivors into the "dying" state in one strike.
