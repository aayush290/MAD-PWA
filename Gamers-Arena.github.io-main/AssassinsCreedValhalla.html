                  <p class="content-text">Assassin's Creed Valhalla is an action role-playing video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the twelfth major installment and the twenty-second release in the Assassin's Creed series, and a successor to the 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Set in the years 872–878 AD, the game recounts a fictional story during the Viking invasion of Britain. The player controls Eivor, a Viking raider who becomes embroiled in the conflict between the Assassin Brotherhood and the Templar Order.<br>
                    <br>
                    The game was released on November 10, 2020, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, and Stadia, while the PlayStation 5 version was released on November 12. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the narrative, characters, voice acting, visuals, soundtrack, world-design and the interconnectivity of activities, with criticism being targeted toward's the game's repetitiveness, numerous game-breaking bugs at launch, for feeling bloated and for prioritising microtransactions over improving the game's experience. Assassin's Creed Valhalla was nominated for Innovation in Accessibility and Best Action/Adventure at The Game Awards 2020.

               Assassin's Creed Valhalla is an open-world action-adventure game structured around several main story arcs and numerous optional side-missions, called "World Events". The player takes on the role of Eivor Varinsdottir (/ˈeɪvɔːr/),[5] a Viking raider, as they lead their fellow Vikings against the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The player has the choice of playing Eivor as either male (voiced by Magnus Bruun), female (voiced by Cecilie Stenspil),[6] or letting the game alternate between the two at key moments in the story (with "Male Eivor" representing the Isu Odin's appearance due to the presence of his DNA within Eivor). The player is also able to customise Eivor's hair, warpaint, clothing, armor, and tattoos.[7] The variety of weapons available to the player has been expanded to include weapons such as flails and greatswords. Combat has been changed to allow dual-wielding of almost any weapon, including shields,[4] and every piece of gear that the player collects is unique.

                The Eagle Vision mechanic of previous titles returns in the form of "Odin Sight".[8] The player's companion animal is a raven named Sýnin[9][10] (Old Norse for "insight")[11][d] who can be used to scout the nearby areas, much like previous avian companions had done in Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey, and other parts of the game world from afar before Eivor engages in combat.[12] There is more focus on the stealth aspects for both traversing the game world and in combat. The "social stealth" concept from earlier Assassin's Creed games returns: Eivor can hide from enemies not only in stationary environmental objects but can pull down his hood and slip into certain crowds to use them as cover. Eivor can feign death, use his raven to distract guards, and can access a hidden blade for near-instantaneous assassinations. The game's key bosses all, through specific combinations of approaches, tactics, and weapon selection, are able to be assassinated through a single attack, but still can be defeated through numerous other routes.

                Valhalla has a familiar structure of main story missions and a number of optional side-missions. While the main storyline in past Assassin's Creed games typically moved linearly through the main sections of the game world, Valhalla has the player often returning back to the main settlement and back to areas previously visited as information about the new areas of England is learned by the Vikings through reconnaissance or from contacts. Not all missions require violent ends, with some that can be resolved through diplomatic means.[14] Player choices through conversation or gameplay options will affect the characters and their political alliances with other non-player characters.[4] The game also relies less on a traditional leveling system and instead focuses more on the selection of skills through skill trees selected by the player as Eivor advances through the game. The difficulty posed by enemies is rated based on the player's collection of skills.
