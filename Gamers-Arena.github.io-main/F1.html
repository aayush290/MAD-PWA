                  <p class="content-text">F1 2020 is the official video game of the 2020 Formula 1 and Formula 2 Championships developed and published by Codemasters. It is the thirteenth title in the Formula 1 series developed by the studio and was released on 7 July for pre-orders of the Michael Schumacher Edition and 10 July for the Seventy Edition on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and, for the first time, Stadia.[1] The game is the twelfth main series installment in the franchise, and it features the twenty-two circuits, twenty drivers and ten teams proposed in the provisional 2020 Formula 1 World Championship.<br>
                    <br>
               F1 2020 features the championship as it was originally intended to be run before the championship was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw several races postponed or cancelled, with races at other circuits held.
               <br>
               <br>    
                The Circuit Zandvoort and the Hanoi Street Circuit — circuits which were new to the championship in 2020 — are included in the game despite the cancellations of the Dutch and Vietnamese Grands Prix. The 70th Anniversary, Eifel, Emilia Romagna, Portuguese, Sakhir, Styrian, Turkish and Tuscan Grands Prix, eight events that were added to the 2020 calendar, are not included as well as the Nürburgring, the Imola Circuit, the Portimão Circuit, the Bahrain International Circuit "Outer Circuit" layout, the Istanbul Park and the Mugello Circuit, as they use circuits that host other events.
                <br><br>
                F1 2020 introduces a team management feature known as "My Team" which allows the player to create, own, and run an eleventh team. The player will initially need to choose an engine supplier, recruit a second driver, design a livery and sign sponsors. As the career mode progresses, they will be able to upgrade the facilities at their team's headquarters and hire staff to continue development. This supplements the development tree used to upgrade the car. Codemasters had previously used the My Team mode in Dirt 4, a part of the Dirt Rally franchise.
                <br><br>
                In career mode players now have the choice to do a half, or a full Formula 2 season or only do three races as in F1 2019, although there is no longer a rivalry story-line and no fictional drivers other than that created by the player. When playing in Formula 1, players can choose between three different season lengths of ten, sixteen or twenty-two races. They are also able to create a custom calendar should they choose a shorter season length.
                <br><br>
                In F1 2020, the AI are more prone to making mistakes to give the players "a much more realistic experience".[10]

The game introduces driver ratings for the first time, with drivers given a score out of ninety-nine for experience, racecraft, awareness and pace. The experience score provides additional 'resource points' to enable the player to upgrade their car faster in the "My Team" and "Career" modes, racecraft relates to the effectiveness of the driver's attempts at overtaking, a higher awareness score improves the ability of the driver to maintain control of their car in difficult situations and pace relates to the driver's ability to set quick lap times. The scores are derived from real life data and applies to F2 drivers as well as those from F1.

Podium Pass is new to F1 2020 and allows players to unlock cosmetic items, such as liveries, race suits and celebration animations. A VIP Podium Pass can also be purchased using in-game Pitcoins, which also includes more exclusive liveries, race suits and celebration animations.

French driver Anthoine Hubert, who lost his life in the feature race at the 2019 Spa-Francorchamps Formula 2 round is also remembered within the game, as a selectable driver in "My Team".

There are 16 classic cars available to use, the oldest being the 1988 McLaren MP4/4 and the newest being the 2010 McLaren MP4-25, Ferrari F10 and Red Bull RB6. Four cars — 1991 Jordan 191, 1994 Benetton B194, 1995 Benetton B195 and 2000 Ferrari F1-2000 — are available to those who purchased the Deluxe Schumacher Edition of the game, or those who purchased the regular edition of the game and later purchased downloadable content.

Codemasters released an update in December in which recreates the 2020 Formula 2 Championship, with Mick Schumacher becoming champion
