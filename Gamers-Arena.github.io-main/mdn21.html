                  <p class="content-text">Madden NFL 21 is an American football video game based on the National Football League (NFL), developed by EA Tiburon and published by Electronic Arts. It is an installment of the long-running Madden NFL series. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on August 28, 2020, and for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on December 4, 2020. It features Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson as the cover athlete, and Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis as its commentators. The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay but criticized its technical issues, while player reception was negative, with many heavily criticizing the lack of innovation.<br>
                    <br>
                    A mobile version, titled Madden NFL 21 Mobile, was released on iOS and Android a few weeks before the game's initial launch as a full rework of the 2014 mobile game Madden NFL Mobile.

               EA Tiburon stated that Madden NFL 21 would include "new innovative gameplay mechanics" that "offer advanced levels of control and inspire creativity on both sides of the ball." The new stick skill ball-carrier system gives the user all-out (?) control, and new pass rush moves were introduced. Changes to tackling and new user-controlled celebrations were also added. This, along with the release date, was revealed in the description of a first-look video originally set to premiere on June 1, but was delayed until June 16 due to the George Floyd protests.

                On September 8, EA announced that Colin Kaepernick would be made available to play in the game and sign as a free agent, the first time he appeared in the franchise since Madden NFL 17. The move was met with a mixed response, due in-part to Kaepernick being rated an 81 overall, higher than other comparable quarterbacks like Ryan Tannehill (80) and Kyler Murray (77).

                The game also features a backyard-style mode known as "The Yard". In addition to the players in the normal game, two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and his brothers Thanasis and Kostas, also NBA players, are playable characters in this mode. An EA promotional video has the three brothers playing in uniforms inspired by their homeland of Greece.[14] In January 2021, an expansion of SpongeBob SquarePants-themed content was added to The Yard (including a Bikini Bottom-themed "reef-top" stadium, and themed modes and cosmetic items), as a cross-promotion for Nickelodeon's simulcast of a January 10 wild card playoff game.
